# example-pokemon-appindicator
The is an example of how to make an Ubuntu AppIndicator in Python 3.

This project exists to show how a very simple AppIndicator can be made in 
Python 3. In particular, when the "Random Pokemon" item is clicked, a Pokemon's 
name is pulled from a public API and displayed via an Ubuntu Notification.

Inspired by the following blog post: [http://candidtim.github.io/appindicator/2014/09/13/ubuntu-appindicator-step-by-step.html](http://candidtim.github.io/appindicator/2014/09/13/ubuntu-appindicator-step-by-step.html).
